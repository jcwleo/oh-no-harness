# Systematic Debugging for Codex

This generated file is the Codex-facing runtime skill document. Codex should read this file directly; maintainers edit the source documents listed below instead.

## Generated Runtime Composition

Source order:

- `../../docs/skill-core/systematic-debugging.md`
- `../../docs/platforms/codex-runtime.md`

The sections below are already composed for this platform. Do not ask the runtime model to load another platform's runtime document or invocation syntax.

# Systematic Debugging

Find the root cause before changing behavior.

This skill is the direct debugging entry point for failures that do not need the full `ralph` execution loop.

## Software Development Stage

Systematic Debugging is the failure-investigation and repair stage.

Use it when tests, builds, runtime behavior, installs, hooks, or user reports show a concrete failure. It should establish reproduction and root cause before returning to implementation or verification.

## When To Use

Use for:

- failing tests, builds, installs, hooks, or smoke checks
- regressions and unexpected behavior
- flaky or environment-sensitive behavior
- performance or integration failures
- repeated unsuccessful fixes

Do not use for greenfield feature work. Use `ralplan` or `ralph` when the task is broader than a bounded failure.

## Agent Roles

Use the listed roles as the failure requires. On subagent-capable hosts, use
isolated diagnostic and evidence roles when they provide decision-changing
evidence, context separation, or latency benefit so logs, traces, and
exploratory output do not pollute the main thread. The normal flow is diagnostic first
(`debugger` and, when context is missing, `explore`), then the minimal fix
(`executor` subagent when the write scope is isolated, otherwise inline with a
recorded reason), then evidence (`verifier`). `plan-reviewer` is a
conditional escalation role, not a required final step: use it immediately when
three fix attempts fail, architecture-level coupling appears, or the apparent
fix would change broad APIs, product behavior, data handling, security, or
delivery scope. Dispatch is governed by the active skill's platform policy and
Ralph's `## Mode-Gated Agent Dispatch` when this debugging pass is inside Ralph.
For direct debugging outside Ralph, apply `docs/shared/ralph-subagent-policy.md`
and `docs/shared/parallel-subagents.md` for role isolation, fallback reasons, and
eligible batch dispatch.

Apply the active platform's dispatch authorization for this skill's diagnostic,
fix, evidence, and post-fix review roles. Do not ask for per-run subagent
approval when the active platform already supplies standing authorization for
eligible `debugger`, `explore`, isolated `executor`, `verifier`, conditional
`plan-reviewer`, or warranted post-fix review roles. Use inline fallback only
when dispatch is unavailable, unsafe to isolate, or too small to benefit, and
record the fallback reason.

Respect the active platform runtime document for dispatch versus inline
execution. Do not collapse diagnostic or evidence roles inline when the host can
dispatch them with an isolated scope. When any listed role is dispatched, apply
the active platform's role prompt and dispatch requirements before the
task-specific failure, scope, expected output, and verification responsibility.

| Agent | Dispatch (when) |
|---|---|
| `debugger` | Dispatch `debugger` subagent to reproduce the failure, identify root cause, and recommend the minimal fix. By default, when the opposite host is available, run the investigation as cross-host analysis per `docs/shared/cross-host-review.md`: the current-host and opposite-host debuggers investigate in parallel and the main agent synthesizes one root-cause direction (competing hypotheses, deciding evidence, smallest next diagnostic). Otherwise use the Same-Host Parallel Fallback per the shared doc. |
| `explore` | Dispatch `explore` subagent to gather codebase facts, related call sites, working examples, and commands. |
| `executor` | Dispatch `executor` subagent to apply the minimal fix only after root cause and reproduction evidence exist. |
| `verifier` | Dispatch `verifier` subagent to confirm the fix and package evidence; its scenario lens covers post-fix validation when the failure affects user-facing flows, scenarios, or acceptance criteria. When the opposite host is available, run this verification as cross-host review per `docs/shared/cross-host-review.md` (current-host + opposite-host instances, union/conservative merged result); otherwise use the Same-Host Parallel Fallback. |
| `plan-reviewer` | Dispatch `plan-reviewer` subagent as a conditional escalation to reassess direction after three failed fix attempts, when architecture-level coupling is exposed, or before broad API/product/data/security/scope changes. When the opposite host is available, run this escalation as cross-host review per `docs/shared/cross-host-review.md` (current-host + opposite-host instances synthesized into one verdict; otherwise use the Same-Host Parallel Fallback). |
| `code-reviewer` | Dispatch `code-reviewer` post-fix when the changed code is nontrivial, shared, workflow-affecting, or maintainability-sensitive, or when its security lens is needed because auth, data, file system, network, secrets, sandbox, or policy-sensitive behavior is touched. When the opposite host is available, run this post-fix review as cross-host review per `docs/shared/cross-host-review.md` (current-host + opposite-host instances; merged findings; otherwise use the Same-Host Parallel Fallback). |

## Debugging Flow

1. Capture the exact failure command, input, environment, or user-visible symptom.
2. Reproduce the failure, or explain why it cannot be reproduced yet.
3. Read the relevant error output, logs, stack trace, and changed files.
4. Find the closest working example in the same codebase.
5. Build a hypothesis ledger before deep investigation:
   - For obvious, localized failures, record the single active hypothesis and
     why additional hypotheses would not change the next diagnostic step.
   - For unknown, nontrivial, flaky, repeated, or cross-boundary failures,
     record 2-3 plausible competing hypotheses before investigating any one
     deeply.
   - For each ledger entry, name the expected confirming evidence, expected
     refuting evidence, current confidence, and the smallest diagnostic step.
6. Select one active root-cause hypothesis from the ledger with evidence.
7. Test the active hypothesis with the smallest diagnostic step, update the
   ledger, and reject or replace the hypothesis when evidence contradicts it.
8. Trace the causal chain from the observed symptom back to the source that made
   the symptom possible. Do not accept a fix plan that only removes the visible
   trigger while leaving the failure mode latent. Before accepting a root cause,
   confirm it falsifiably with a causal toggle: toggling the suspected cause
   makes the failure appear and reverting it makes it disappear. When a clean
   toggle is not feasible (for example a race or environment-dependent failure),
   state why and name the next-strongest confirming evidence (such as a
   deterministic reproduction under the cause) instead of treating a plausible
   trace as proof.
9. For behavior fixes, read and follow `test-driven-development` to create a
   failing reproduction test before changing production code.
10. If reproduction and hypothesis evidence exist but the diagnosis remains
    contradictory, repeatedly inconclusive, or blocked after ordinary diagnostic
    passes, read and follow `fusion-rescue`. Return control to
    Systematic Debugging with the synthesis before applying a fix.
11. Apply the minimal fix with `executor` when the write scope is isolated; use
    inline work only with a recorded reason.
12. Dispatch warranted post-fix review roles when the changed scope or risk
    requires them.
13. Run the reproduction check, relevant regression checks, and
    `verification-before-completion` before claiming the failure is fixed. The
    verification evidence must show that the failure mode is gone, not only that
    the current trigger no longer appears in this environment.

Parallel hypothesis testing for steps 5-7: when reproduction is established and
two or more plausible root-cause hypotheses are independently testable, dispatch
one `debugger` subagent per hypothesis (cap 3) in a single batch. Step 6's
one-active-hypothesis rule applies per debugger agent: each parallel debugger
receives exactly one hypothesis, the confirming/refuting evidence it should look
for, and its read-only diagnostic scope. Each parallel debugger runs only
non-mutating diagnostics in disjoint scopes and returns evidence, confidence
movement, and rejected-hypothesis rationale; if diagnostics would mutate state
or scopes overlap, keep the sequential one-active-hypothesis flow above. The
main thread synthesizes the returned evidence, selects the confirmed root cause,
and a single `executor` applies the fix. Below two hypotheses, or when
hypotheses are not independently testable, the sequential flow above applies
unchanged.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask or escalate to `plan-reviewer` when:

- the failure cannot be reproduced and more data is needed from the user
- a `plan-reviewer` escalation trigger from `## Agent Roles` fires (repeated
  failed fix attempts; broad architecture or API scope; product behavior,
  data handling, security, or delivery-scope ambiguity)

## Anti-Patterns

- Changing code before reproducing or locating the failure.
- Fixing the stack-trace line when the bad value originated elsewhere.
- Bundling cleanup or refactors with a bug fix.
- Adding broad retries, catch-all handlers, or sleeps without evidence.
- Treating a later passing test as TDD evidence when no failing reproduction was
  observed first.
- Treating a passing trigger check as proof when the underlying failure mode or
  causal chain was not closed.
- Skipping competing hypotheses for an unknown or repeated failure because one
  log line looks familiar.

## Output

Return:

- Failure reproduced or reproduction blocker.
- Hypothesis ledger, including rejected hypotheses and evidence.
- Root cause and evidence.
- Causal chain and why the fix removes the failure mode.
- Causal toggle: the on/off observation, or "not feasible" with the reason and next-strongest confirming evidence.
- Reproduction test or documented exception.
- Fix summary.
- Verification commands and results.
- Residual risk.

## Next Skill Handoff

None — this is a failure-investigation mid-loop skill. It may use
`fusion-rescue` as a bounded internal escalation when ordinary diagnostics
stall, then return to this debugging flow. After verification, return the result
to the caller (`ralph`, `ultrawork`, or direct invocation). Do not chain to
another workflow skill.

# Codex Runtime Rules

This compact platform section is embedded in generated Codex-facing skill
documents.

## Skill Loading

Codex-facing public skills live under `skills/`. Generated
`skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` files compose the matching skill core, this compact
runtime section, and any Codex skill-specific overlay such as
`docs/platforms/codex-<skill>.md`.

## User Approval And Prompting

Ask approval, preference, scope, or next-step questions directly in the Codex
conversation. Keep prompts outcome-first: state the desired outcome,
acceptance criteria, non-goals or side effects, expected evidence, and output
shape before detailed steps.

Use compact final answers unless the active skill requires a plan, review, or
verification report. Preserve durable state in written artifacts before long
work, compaction, or handoff.

## Role Dispatch

Codex role dispatch is host-policy controlled. Use `spawn_agent` only when the
host exposes it, the active skill permits dispatch, and the role has isolated
read-only scope, disjoint write ownership, or an independent review or
verification responsibility.

For Oh No Harness roles, use the registered custom agent first:
`spawn_agent(agent_type="oh-no-<role>", ...)`. Generic fallback is allowed only
inside an active Oh No Harness workflow or explicit user-requested subagent
task after an actual `agent_type="oh-no-<role>"` attempt is rejected as unknown
or unavailable, and the fallback reason is recorded. Do not infer custom-agent
unavailability from rendered schema text, display comments, or uncertainty.

Do not combine `agent_type="oh-no-<role>"` with `fork_context=true` or any
full-history fork request. Pass the current scope, constraints, expected output,
and lifecycle in the spawned-agent message, using one payload shape only.

The Codex SessionStart standing authorization, a user standing preference, an
approved plan profile, or an active Oh No Harness skill policy is workflow-level
authorization for eligible isolated subagents. Do not ask another per-run
approval question only to dispatch those roles. Dispatch only when the result
can change implementation, review, verification, latency, context management,
or the ship/block decision.

After `wait_agent` returns a final status, capture the output and any
changed-file set before cleanup. A timeout, empty wait, or "No agents completed
yet" result is not final and is not permission to close the subagent. Once a
role is dispatched, its assigned scope, role, and expected output become a
workflow dependency. Wait until every in-scope dispatched subagent reaches final
status, capture its result, and use that result in synthesis, implementation,
review, verification, or an explicit blocked/abandoned record before advancing
past the dependent step or claiming completion. While waiting, continue only
genuinely non-overlapping local work. Do not redo delegated work inline, spawn
a duplicate replacement, or let parent inline analysis substitute for the
subagent result merely because the subagent is slow. Never use missing output
as completion evidence.

Close or clean up a subagent without a captured final result only when the user
explicitly cancels or stops that subagent, the task scope invalidates the work,
the spawn was duplicate or mis-scoped, or continuing creates a safety, security,
or filesystem risk. Record that close as cancelled or abandoned.

## Generic Role Prompt Fallback

When generic Codex agent types are used after confirmed custom-agent
unavailability, embed the matching `docs/agent-core/<role>.md` prompt body in
the spawned-agent message. If only `agents/<role>.md` exists, strip Claude Code
YAML frontmatter before embedding.

## Cross-Host Consult Channel

This is the shared cross-host consult mechanism used by Fusion Rescue and by
cross-host review (`docs/shared/cross-host-review.md`). On Codex the opposite
host is Claude Code. This section carries only the Codex-to-Claude invocation;
the activation, synthesis, and recursion-guard semantics live in the calling
skill core and the shared doc.

From Codex, consult Claude Code through `${CLAUDE_BIN:-claude}` only when the
active Codex permission state is exactly `danger-full-access`. If the state is
missing, unknown, `read-only`, `workspace-write`, or anything else, do not call
Claude: treat the opposite host as unavailable; in default mode the calling skill
applies the shared cross-host contract's Same-Host Parallel Fallback
(`docs/shared/cross-host-review.md`), and require-cross-host mode blocks while
naming the failure class and the current-host fallback.

When the `danger-full-access` preflight confirms, build the Claude command as an
argument vector, not shell string interpolation: `${CLAUDE_BIN:-claude}`,
`--print`, `--model`, `opus`, `--permission-mode`, `dontAsk`,
`--no-session-persistence`, then the redacted prompt packet, unless the user
supplied a different Claude model. Do not strip Claude's tools by default; Claude
may need its own read-only tools to produce the assigned analysis. The read-only
boundary is enforced by the redacted packet and host permissions, not by
removing tools.

The consult must return Claude's actual assigned analysis synchronously. A launch
notice, queued-job message, background acknowledgement, or status pointer is not
a valid opposite-host response; treat it as unavailable. The Claude prompt must
request only the assigned analysis and must forbid file edits, writes, installs,
mutating commands, nested rescue, and any host-to-host ping-pong back to Codex or
a third host (one cross-host hop). Redact secrets before sending; on failure
record only the failure class and command/path/auth status, never secret values.
