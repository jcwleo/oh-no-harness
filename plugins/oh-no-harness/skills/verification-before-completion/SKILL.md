# Verification Before Completion for Codex

This generated file is the Codex-facing runtime skill document. Codex should read this file directly; maintainers edit the source documents listed below instead.

## Generated Runtime Composition

Source order:

- `../../docs/skill-core/verification-before-completion.md`
- `../../docs/platforms/codex.md`

The sections below are already composed for this platform. Do not ask the runtime model to load another platform's runtime document or invocation syntax.

# Verification Before Completion

Do not claim success without fresh evidence.

This skill is both a standalone lightweight final gate and the final evidence gate inside `ralph` and `ultrawork`. When those stronger workflows are active, use this skill to verify the final claim without weakening their PRD, review, cleanup, or QA requirements.

## Software Development Stage

Verification Before Completion is the final evidence stage.

Use it after implementation, debugging, cleanup, and relevant review are done, immediately before claiming the work is complete, fixed, passing, ready, or safe to deliver.

## When To Use

Use before saying that:

- a task is complete
- a bug is fixed
- tests, lint, build, install, or smoke checks pass
- a plugin, skill, hook, or agent is ready
- a branch or artifact is ready for user review

Do not use as a substitute for `ralph` when the work needs PRD tracking, cleanup, and review loops.

## Agent Roles

| Agent | Use |
|---|---|
| `verifier` | Map the claim to evidence and run or inspect the required checks; apply the scenario lens to validate user-facing flows or scenario coverage. |
| `code-reviewer` | Review behavior-affecting code or workflow prompt changes when risk warrants it; apply the security lens to auth, data, file system, network, secrets, or policy-sensitive changes. |

On subagent-capable hosts, dispatch `verifier` for nontrivial completion claims
when independent evidence mapping can change the ship/block decision or expose
residual risk. Add a `code-reviewer` subagent (security lens included) when the
changed scope, selected verification tier, or user-facing risk warrants it;
`verifier` applies its scenario lens when user-facing behavior changed.
Inline verification is appropriate only for tiny direct checks with no
context-separation benefit or when dispatch is unavailable; record that fallback
or no-benefit reason before making the claim.

Apply the active platform's dispatch authorization for the eligible `verifier`
and risk-gated `code-reviewer` roles in this skill. Do not ask for per-run
subagent approval when the active platform already supplies standing
authorization for those evidence or review roles, the claim is nontrivial, risk
warrants them, and the role output can change the completion decision.

When any verification role is dispatched, apply the active platform's role
prompt and dispatch requirements before the claim, evidence scope, expected
output, and no-edit instruction for read-only review roles.

## Required Gate

Before making a completion claim:

1. State the exact claim to verify.
2. Identify the command, artifact, diff inspection, or checklist that can prove it.
3. Run or inspect the evidence fresh in the current work pass.
4. Read the output and exit status.
5. Compare evidence to acceptance criteria.
6. Complete the Risk Check Before Completion below.
7. Report skipped checks and residual risk.

If no meaningful command exists, inspect the changed files and write a manual verification checklist instead of implying automated confidence.

When measurable evidence influenced the work, also apply
`docs/shared/validation-check.md`. Treat that evidence as a diagnostic
signal, not as the acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance-To-Evidence Mapping

Do not treat a command list as proof by itself. Before claiming completion,
map each acceptance criterion or requested behavior to concrete evidence:

```text
Acceptance-to-evidence mapping:
- Criterion:
  - Evidence:
  - Coverage strength: direct | indirect | manual | missing
  - Gap or residual risk:
```

Direct evidence is a focused test, scenario, or inspection that would fail if
the requested behavior were absent or wrong. Indirect evidence, broad suites,
lint, typecheck, formatting, and compile checks are useful support, but they do
not replace direct acceptance evidence for behavior-changing work.
New tests are supporting evidence, not sufficient completion proof, when nearby
existing tests, smoke checks, or behavior-preserving inspections are available
and could catch regressions.

## Risk Check Before Completion

Before final completion, actively look for the most likely way local green
evidence could still miss the real user, maintainer, or uncovered behavior.
Keep the questions category-level and requirements-driven instead of
case-specific.

Record:

```text
Risk check before completion:
- Acceptance criteria covered by direct evidence:
- Acceptance criteria only covered indirectly:
- Contract surface and semantic model checked:
- Baseline guard: existing test, smoke, inspection, or no viable baseline reason:
- Likely failure-taxonomy risk a skeptical maintainer would test:
- One more useful failing test I would write if time allowed:
- Completion claim:
```

The completion claim should distinguish:

- complete with direct evidence, baseline guard satisfied or unavailable with reason, and no blocking review findings
- locally verified with explicit residual risk
- blocked or failed verification because evidence or review blockers remain

## Validation Check

For evidence-informed work, record a `Validation check` using the canonical
template in `docs/shared/validation-check.md`. Include the evidence used, the
supported acceptance criterion or user outcome, proof and gap, recurring risk
addressed, similar-work expectation, excluded case-specific details, added
process cost, and completion claim.

Reject completion claims whose only support is metric movement, unseen-check
guessing, task-name-specific guidance, or a measurable metric that does not match the
real user, maintainer, operator, or public contract.

## Evidence Rules

- A previous run is not fresh evidence unless no file or dependency changed since that run.
- A passing lint check does not prove tests pass.
- A passing unit test does not prove a user-facing flow works when the acceptance criteria require the flow.
- A broad suite pass does not prove a new semantic contract unless the new
  behavior is directly represented in that suite.
- A local test that would pass against the wrong public, caller, or
  verifier-facing surface does not prove the real contract.
- A new test does not replace a viable nearby baseline or smoke check for
  regression-sensitive work.
- For behavior-changing work, verify RED/GREEN/REFACTOR evidence or a documented TDD exception.
- When an agent reports success, inspect the changed files or artifacts before repeating the claim.

## Output

Return:

- Claim verified.
- Evidence used.
- Commands or inspections performed.
- Acceptance criteria status.
- Acceptance-to-evidence mapping.
- Contract surface and baseline guard status.
- Risk check before completion and completion claim.
- Validation check and risk from metric-only evidence when applicable.
- Skipped checks and reason.
- Residual risk.

## Next Skill Handoff

None — this is the final evidence gate. Return the result to the caller (`ralph`, `ultrawork`, or direct invocation). Do not chain to another workflow skill.

# Codex Platform Rules

This platform section is source content for generated Codex-facing runtime
skill documents.

## Skill Loading

Codex-facing public skills live under `skills/`. Files in
`skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` are generated runtime documents composed from the
matching `docs/skill-core/<skill>.md` file, this Codex platform file, and any
Codex skill-specific overlay such as `docs/platforms/codex-<skill>.md`.

## User Approval

When a core skill asks for approval, preference, scope, or next-step selection,
ask the user directly in the current Codex conversation. Present options as
actions the host agent will take. Do not tell the user to run a command manually
when the skill handoff expects the host agent to invoke the next skill.

## Auto Routing

The `auto-routing` skill can explain and preserve the config file shape in
Codex, but it does not add forced routing to Codex SessionStart. Codex native
skill loading remains the primary routing surface. If Codex-facing
SessionStart hooks run, they must stay compact and must not embed full skill
core bodies.

## OpenAI-Aligned Prompting

This file carries the runtime-sized OpenAI guidance for Codex. The longer
maintenance reference lives in `docs/providers/openai.md`, but generated
Codex-facing runtime skill documents do not include provider docs as an extra
runtime source.

For OpenAI/Codex models, keep prompts outcome-first:

- state the desired outcome, acceptance criteria, non-goals or side effects,
  and expected evidence before detailed steps
- keep tool and role instructions close to the place where the tool or role is
  used
- specify output shape for plans, reviews, verification, and final reports
- use compact final answers unless the active skill requires an evidence log or
  approval brief
- preserve durable state in written artifacts before long work, compaction, or
  handoff

When the host exposes reasoning or verbosity controls, use the lightest setting
that can produce credible evidence. Raise effort for broad planning, deep code
review, hard debugging, or multi-agent integration; lower it for small,
mechanical, or already-isolated work.

## Role Dispatch

Codex role dispatch is host-policy controlled. Use `spawn_agent` only when the
current host tool definition exposes it, the active skill permits dispatch, and
the role has an isolated read-only scope, disjoint write ownership, or an
independent review or verification responsibility.

When dispatching an Oh No Harness role in any Codex context, including active
skills, approved plan handoffs, SessionStart-authorized read-only exploration,
or general user-requested subagent work outside a selected skill, use the
registered custom agent first. If the host recognizes or accepts
`oh-no-<role>`, call
`spawn_agent(agent_type="oh-no-<role>", ...)`. Do not choose built-in
`explorer`, `worker`, `default`, or a prompt-embedded generic subagent for an Oh
No Harness role while the matching registered custom agent is available.
Do not infer custom-agent unavailability from rendered schema text, display
comments, or uncertainty. Generic/default fallback is allowed only inside an
active Oh No Harness workflow or explicit user-requested subagent task after an
actual `agent_type="oh-no-<role>"` attempt is rejected as unknown or unavailable
and the confirmed fallback reason is recorded. The no-skill read-only
exploration lane below must not use generic/default fallback.

Do not combine `agent_type = "oh-no-<role>"` with `fork_context = true` or any
full-history fork request. Codex full-history forks inherit the parent agent
configuration and cannot be used with a custom role agent type. Put the required
scope, constraints, and evidence context in the spawned-agent message instead.
Use one spawn payload shape only: prompt/message or items, never both.

Explicit user or plan wording such as `subagent`, `spawn`, `delegate`,
`parallel agents`, `parallel subagents`, or `one agent per` is sufficient when
the host permits dispatch. A user standing preference, approved plan profile, or
active Oh No Harness skill policy to use eligible subagents proactively is also
workflow-level authorization, so the user does not need to repeat literal
subagent wording on every Ralph step. Eligibility still depends on isolation and
decision-changing value, not authorization alone.

When the Codex SessionStart context includes
`CODEX_ONLY_OH_NO_SUBAGENT_STANDING_AUTHORIZATION`, treat that standing
authorization as the explicit user request for Oh No Harness sub-agents,
delegation, and parallel agent work in the current session. Do not ask a
separate per-run approval question merely to use eligible subagents inside an
active Oh No Harness workflow.

When the user, plan, or skill states a standing preference to maximize
subagents, treat that as explicit authorization for eligible isolated roles
inside the active workflow. Keep Codex host-policy limits, but do not require
the user to repeat literal subagent wording on every step. Do not dispatch a
role whose output would not change the implementation, review, verification, or
ship/block decision.

When no explicit request, standing preference, approved plan trigger, or active
skill dispatch policy exists, do not spawn Codex subagents merely because a role
could be named. Keep the role inline and record the fallback reason when the
core skill requires it.

The only no-skill exception is the Codex SessionStart block named
`CODEX_ONLY_OH_NO_READONLY_EXPLORATION_DELEGATION`. It authorizes one
exploration subagent for simple read-only repository fact lookup prompts such as
locating logic, tracing a symbol, identifying related tests, or summarizing an
existing file/config path. It does not authorize planning, debugging,
implementation, review (security lens included), scenario QA, completion
verification, ambiguous-requirements work, or file edits. It must not read or
reproduce secrets unless the user explicitly asks for that sensitive lookup, and
credential values must be redacted in subagent output. This no-skill lane may
dispatch only the registered read-only `oh-no-explore` custom agent when the
current host recognizes it; if that agent is unavailable, answer inline instead
of falling back to a generic or prompt-embedded subagent. If `agent_type =
"oh-no-explore"` is rejected as unknown or unavailable, do not retry with a
generic subagent for this lane. When this lane spawns `oh-no-explore`, use
`wait_agent` as the next lifecycle tool for that receiver, repeated until it
returns that receiver with final status `completed`, before calling
`close_agent`; a timeout, empty wait, or no-completion result is not captured
evidence. `close_agent` output is not a substitute for the required wait result
and must not be the first result capture. The forbidden order is `spawn_agent`
then `close_agent`. Even if `close_agent` returns output, that output is not
valid first result capture. If you will not call `wait_agent` first, do not
spawn; perform the lookup inline.

For approved `ralplan` handoffs to ordinary `oh-no-harness:ralph`, treat
`Parallel trigger: approved-plan-handoff` as dispatch authorization for
eligible isolated roles. Do not require a separate `ralph with parallel
subagents` option when the plan already lists roles whose output can change the
implementation, review, verification, or ship/block decision.

For `ralplan`, Planner and Plan-Reviewer keep sequential role boundaries:
Planner produces the draft, then Plan-Reviewer reviews that draft. Dispatch them
as sequential subagents when the active host supports dispatch and independent
context can improve planning or review; otherwise keep separate inline role
blocks. A re-review dispatch happens only when blocking findings require a
Planner revision.

After `wait_agent` returns a final status for any Codex-dispatched role,
capture the output and any changed-file set before cleanup. A timeout, empty
wait result, or "No agents completed yet" result is not a final status and is
not permission to close the subagent. Hard rule: MUST NOT call `close_agent`
for a running or pending subagent merely because it is slow. Leave the subagent
running, wait longer when its result is still needed, continue with
non-overlapping local work, or record the role as pending or blocked. Close
without a captured final result only when the user explicitly cancels or stops
that subagent, the task scope invalidates the work, the spawn was duplicate or
mis-scoped, or continuing creates a safety, security, or filesystem risk. Record
that close as cancelled or abandoned and never use missing output as completion
evidence. When no further input is needed for a completed, failed, cancelled,
user-cancelled, scope-invalidated, or unsafe subagent, call `close_agent` and
record the result.

When dispatch is unavailable, keep the same role boundary inline and record the
fallback reason when the core skill requires it.

## Optional Named Custom Agents

Oh No Harness Codex custom-agent templates are installed in user scope by
default with `scripts/install-codex-agents`. User scope means
`$CODEX_HOME/agents` when `CODEX_HOME` is set, otherwise
`$HOME/.codex/agents`. Project scope means `.codex/agents`.

Custom agents are standalone TOML files under those `agents/` directories; they
are not defined inside `config.toml`. Codex `[agents]` config entries are global
subagent settings, not individual Oh No Harness role definitions.
Generated Codex custom-agent descriptions stay role-only. Their
`developer_instructions` provide the stable role contract, while the
`spawn_agent` message supplies the current story scope, acceptance criteria,
contract surface, baseline guard, expected output, and lifecycle.

Codex `SessionStart` runs a best-effort user-scope quiet ensure with
`scripts/install-codex-agents --scope user --ensure --quiet`. It installs
missing generated files and refreshes stale generated files without adding
success output to the session context. If installation fails or an unmarked user
file blocks ensure, SessionStart keeps running and adds only a compact fallback
warning.

When a Codex Ralph prompt is detected, the Ralph platform adapter repeats the
same quiet ensure as a fallback before injecting dispatch guidance. Generated
files include the installed plugin version marker, so a later plugin update can
refresh stale `oh-no-*` agent definitions during SessionStart or Ralph fallback
without requiring a repeated user prompt. If ensure fails or an unmarked user
file blocks it, record the ensure failure but do not treat that failure alone
as permission for generic prompt-embedded fallback. Continue with
`agent_type = "oh-no-<role>"` if the current host recognizes that custom agent;
use generic prompt-embedded fallback only after confirmed custom-agent
unavailability and record that fallback reason.

Files ensured on disk are not the same thing as same-session named-agent
availability. Use `agent_type = "oh-no-<role>"` whenever the current Codex host
recognizes that registered custom agent. Inside an active Oh No Harness
workflow, use the generic prompt-embedded fallback below or built-in `explorer`
only after the host returns `unknown agent_type` or an equivalent explicit
rejection for `oh-no-<role>`, or the user-scope templates are unavailable and
the host cannot recognize the custom agent. Outside an active workflow, the
no-skill read-only exploration lane must stay inline unless registered
`oh-no-explore` is available.
The generated `oh-no-explore` template sets `sandbox_mode = "read-only"` so the
no-skill exploration lane does not rely on prompt text alone for write
isolation.

The generated templates pin `gpt-5.5` and a per-agent
`model_reasoning_effort` so custom-agent role files do not depend on
inheriting a user-specific model layer.

When the active Codex host recognizes a registered custom agent, `agent_type =
"oh-no-<role>"` is the required path for Oh No Harness role dispatch. If the
host returns an unknown `agent_type`, or if the user-scope templates are not
installed and the host cannot recognize the agent, fall back to the
prompt-embedded dispatch contract below and record the confirmed fallback
reason. Do not infer unavailability from memory, stale examples, display names,
rendered schema comments, or uncertainty about the schema.

Custom-agent dispatch must pass context through the message and leave
full-history forking disabled. If a role truly needs the entire parent history,
keep that role inline or use a host-supported non-custom fork path and record the
fallback reason. Do not send both message and items in one spawn request.

## Role Prompt Embedding

When using generic Codex agent types, read the matching
`docs/agent-core/<role>.md` file and embed that platform-neutral prompt body in
the spawned-agent message. Do not rely on the role name alone unless the
registered `oh-no-<role>` custom agent supplies the role developer
instructions.

If `docs/agent-core/<role>.md` is unavailable but `agents/<role>.md` exists,
strip the Claude Code YAML frontmatter before embedding. Claude-only
frontmatter such as `tools`, `model`, `background`, `isolation`, or `color` is
metadata for Claude Code and must not be included in Codex spawned-agent prompt
content.

Every generic Codex role dispatch must include:

```text
Agent prompt source: docs/agent-core/<role>.md
Agent prompt content:
<matching docs/agent-core/<role>.md prompt content>
```
