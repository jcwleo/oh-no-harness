# Auto Routing

Every platform bootstrap always carries compact native skill-loading guidance
plus the baseline no-route and direct-edit lanes from `using-oh-no-harness`.
Auto Routing controls whether Claude Code SessionStart adds the stronger
forced-routing layer. The toggle only adds or removes that opt-in layer; it does
not change the baseline lanes on any platform or add hidden runtime routing.

## Software Development Stage

Auto Routing is a workflow-entry configuration stage, not a software development stage.

Use it to make future sessions more likely to choose the right skill before work starts. It should not gather requirements, plan, edit code, debug failures, clean code, or verify completion.

## When To Use

Use when the user asks to:

- enable, turn on, activate, or make skill routing more automatic
- disable, turn off, deactivate, or make skill routing quieter
- check current auto-routing status
- preserve stronger or weaker routing behavior across plugin updates

Do not use as a substitute for skill selection inside the current session — for choosing a workflow skill in the current turn, read and follow `using-oh-no-harness`.

## Platform Behavior

Apply the active platform runtime document before changing settings. Some
platforms support persistent bootstrap routing; others can only explain the
setting and leave runtime behavior unchanged.

When the active platform supports persistent bootstrap routing, changes take
effect on the next bootstrap or session-start event, such as a new session, app
restart, clear/reset command, or compaction. Existing session context is not
rewritten.

## Configuration

The setting is stored outside the plugin cache so updates do not overwrite it.

Preferred location when the active platform provides plugin data:

```text
<platform-plugin-data>/config.json
```

The bundled `scripts/oh-no-config` script resolves the data directory; the
platform runtime document names the plugin root.

Fallback location when no platform plugin-data directory exists:

```text
${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/oh-no-harness/config.json
```

Stored shape:

```json
{
  "autoRouting": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

## Commands

When Bash is available, use the bundled script instead of editing config by hand.

When the active platform runtime document exposes the plugin root:

```bash
"<plugin-root>/scripts/oh-no-config" status
"<plugin-root>/scripts/oh-no-config" on
"<plugin-root>/scripts/oh-no-config" off
```

If the plugin root is not exposed, resolve the installed script with the active platform runtime document's script-locator.

## Response Rules

- For `on`, enable the setting, report the config path, and tell the user to
  restart or clear the active platform session before expecting the new behavior.
- For `off`, disable the setting, report the config path, and tell the user to
  restart or clear the active platform session before expecting the new behavior.
- For `status`, report whether auto-routing is on or off and where the setting is stored.
- If Bash is unavailable, explain the config file shape without claiming the setting changed.
- Do not invoke workflow skills from this configuration skill.
