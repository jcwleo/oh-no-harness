# Claude Code Runtime Rules

This compact platform section is embedded in generated Claude Code-facing skill
documents.

## Skill Loading

Claude Code-facing public skills live under `skills-claude/`. Generated
`skills-claude/<skill>/SKILL.md` files compose the matching skill core, this
compact runtime section, and any Claude Code skill-specific overlay such as
`docs/platforms/claude-code-<skill>.md`. Slash commands must delegate to the
matching generated skill document.

## User Approval, Tasks, And Prompting

Use the host's structured question tool when available for approval,
preference, scope, or next-step selection; otherwise ask one focused plain-text
question and wait. Present options as actions the host agent will take.

When a core skill has a multi-phase approval handoff and the host exposes task
tracking, create one task per phase and complete them sequentially.

Keep Claude prompts explicit and sectioned: state scope, non-goals,
constraints, approval gates, expected evidence, and output format. Preserve
long-running context in artifacts before compaction, task handoff, or subagent
dispatch.

## Role Dispatch

Use the available Task, Agent, Workflow `agent()`, or subagent mechanism for
role dispatch. Prefer plugin-scoped agents named `oh-no-harness:<role>` when
the host lists them.

For independent read-only, review, verification, QA, security, or exploration
work, request background subagents and start the whole independent batch before
waiting for any one result. When a skill requires an atomic same-phase batch,
prefer Workflow `Promise.all` if available; otherwise do not inspect or
summarize early task results until the full intended batch has been requested.

After a Claude Code subagent reaches final status, capture the output and any
changed-file set before cleanup. When no further input is needed, close or
clean up the completed subagent with the mechanism exposed by the host; if none
is available, record that fallback.

For approved `ralplan` handoffs to ordinary `oh-no-harness:ralph`, treat
`Parallel trigger: approved-plan-handoff` as dispatch authorization for
eligible isolated roles. Do not require a separate `ralph with parallel
subagents` option when the plan already lists roles whose output can change the
implementation, review, verification, or ship/block decision.

If plugin-scoped agents are unavailable, keep the same role boundary by
embedding the matching `agents/<role>.md` prompt into the available subagent
mechanism. If no dispatch mechanism is available, keep the role inline and
record the fallback reason when the core skill requires it.

## Cross-Host Consult Channel

This is the shared cross-host consult mechanism used by Fusion Rescue and by
cross-host review (`docs/shared/cross-host-review.md`). On Claude Code the
opposite host is Codex. This section carries only the Claude-to-Codex
invocation; the activation, synthesis, and recursion-guard semantics live in the
calling skill core and the shared doc.

From Claude Code, the current-host main agent consults Codex only by dispatching
the dedicated read-only consult agent `oh-no-harness:<role>-codex` for the
assigned opposite-host leg, where `<role>` is `plan-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`,
or `debugger` for shared cross-host review, or `fusion` for a Fusion Rescue panel
slot. That consult agent resolves the Codex companion path and runs one
synchronous, read-only `codex-companion.mjs task` call: it omits the write flag
so the companion sandbox is read-only (best-effort, not a guarantee — see the
consult agent cores), and it never runs the call as a detached background job. If the companion is unavailable or unresolvable, treat the
opposite host as unavailable; in default mode the calling skill applies the
shared cross-host contract's Same-Host Parallel Fallback
(`docs/shared/cross-host-review.md`), and require-cross-host mode blocks. Name the
failure class and the current-host fallback.

The consult must return Codex's actual assigned analysis synchronously. The
`codex-companion.mjs` call passes the scoped, redacted packet with `--prompt-file`
and must not run in the background. A response that only acknowledges a queued or
background job — text that a task started in the background with a status command
for a job id — is not a valid opposite-host response; treat it as no Codex
response and degrade (default) or block (require-cross-host). Do not poll status
or fetch a deferred result to compensate; the consult call itself must return the
analysis.

For shared cross-host review, the packet the `oh-no-harness:<role>-codex` agent
sends must instruct Codex to dispatch the matching `oh-no-<role>` role agent for
the assigned opposite-host pass, where `<role>` is `plan-reviewer`,
`code-reviewer`, or `debugger`. Codex must wait for that dispatched role agent and
return its assigned role result, and the consult agent must require role-ownership
proof that the dispatched role agent — not a parent inline Codex answer — produced
it. A direct Codex parent answer is not a
valid opposite-host shared review response. If Codex cannot dispatch the matching
role agent, or the role-ownership proof is missing, treat the opposite host as
unavailable in default mode or block in require-cross-host mode; do not accept
inline Codex parent analysis as the cross-host pass. Role ownership is best-effort
— there is no host selector that forces it — so it is required and proven, not
assumed.

Fusion Rescue panel slots remain governed by the Fusion Rescue panel contract;
the role-agent requirement above applies only to shared cross-host review. The
`oh-no-harness:fusion-codex` panel slot dispatches `oh-no-fusion-rescue-analyst`
for one assigned lens (see `docs/platforms/claude-code-fusion-rescue.md`).

The outbound packet must request only the assigned analysis and must forbid the
opposite host from invoking further rescue, another workflow skill, or any
host-to-host call back to Claude Code or a third host (one cross-host hop).
Redact secrets before sending; on failure record only the failure class and
companion/path/auth status, never secret values.
