# Claude Code Runtime Rules

This compact platform section is embedded in generated Claude Code-facing skill
documents.

## Skill Loading

Claude Code-facing public skills live under `skills-claude/`. Generated
`skills-claude/<skill>/SKILL.md` files compose the matching skill core, this
compact runtime section, and any Claude Code skill-specific overlay such as
`docs/platforms/claude-code-<skill>.md`. Slash commands must delegate to the
matching generated skill document.

## User Approval, Tasks, And Prompting

Use the host's structured question tool when available for approval,
preference, scope, or next-step selection; otherwise ask one focused plain-text
question and wait. Present options as actions the host agent will take.

When a core skill has a multi-phase approval handoff and the host exposes task
tracking, create one task per phase and complete them sequentially.

Keep Claude prompts explicit and sectioned: state scope, non-goals,
constraints, approval gates, expected evidence, and output format. Preserve
long-running context in artifacts before compaction, task handoff, or subagent
dispatch.

## Role Dispatch

Dispatch only after the active skill's trigger fires, then read
`docs/platforms/claude-code.md` `## Role Dispatch` for the full host contract.
Prefer `oh-no-harness:<role>`, request the whole independent batch before
waiting, capture every final result, and clean up only after integration. An
approved-plan handoff is dispatch authorization for eligible isolated roles;
plugin-agent unavailability uses the documented embedded-role fallback.

## Cross-Host Consult Channel

This channel is trigger-loaded, not embedded in every workflow decision. When a
named THOROUGH paired-review or Fusion Rescue trigger fires, read and apply
`docs/platforms/claude-code.md` `## Cross-Host Consult Channel` before dispatch.
Until then, do not preload opposite-host invocation details.
