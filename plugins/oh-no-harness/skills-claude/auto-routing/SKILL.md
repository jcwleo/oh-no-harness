# Auto Routing for Claude Code

This generated file is the Claude Code-facing runtime skill document. Claude Code slash commands should read this file directly; maintainers edit the source documents listed below instead.

## Generated Runtime Composition

Source order:

- `../../docs/skill-core/auto-routing.md`
- `../../docs/platforms/claude-code.md`

The sections below are already composed for this platform. Do not ask the runtime model to load another platform's runtime document or invocation syntax.

# Auto Routing

Auto Routing controls whether a supported platform bootstrap hook adds stronger
skill-selection guidance to `using-oh-no-harness`.

It does not add hidden runtime routing. It only changes persistent user preference for the SessionStart prompt.

## Software Development Stage

Auto Routing is a workflow-entry configuration stage, not a software development stage.

Use it to make future sessions more likely to choose the right skill before work starts. It should not gather requirements, plan, edit code, debug failures, clean code, or verify completion.

## When To Use

Use when the user asks to:

- enable, turn on, activate, or make skill routing more automatic
- disable, turn off, deactivate, or make skill routing quieter
- check current auto-routing status
- preserve stronger or weaker routing behavior across plugin updates

Do not use as a substitute for skill selection inside the current session — for choosing a workflow skill in the current turn, read and follow `using-oh-no-harness`.

## Platform Behavior

Apply the active platform runtime document before changing settings. Some
platforms support persistent bootstrap routing; others can only explain the
setting and leave runtime behavior unchanged.

When the active platform supports persistent bootstrap routing, changes take
effect on the next bootstrap or session-start event, such as a new session, app
restart, clear/reset command, or compaction. Existing session context is not
rewritten.

## Configuration

The setting is stored outside the plugin cache so updates do not overwrite it.

Preferred location when the active platform provides plugin data:

```text
<platform-plugin-data>/config.json
```

The bundled `scripts/oh-no-config` script resolves the data directory; the
platform runtime document names the plugin root.

Fallback location when no platform plugin-data directory exists:

```text
${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/oh-no-harness/config.json
```

Stored shape:

```json
{
  "autoRouting": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

## Commands

When Bash is available, use the bundled script instead of editing config by hand.

When the active platform runtime document exposes the plugin root:

```bash
"<plugin-root>/scripts/oh-no-config" status
"<plugin-root>/scripts/oh-no-config" on
"<plugin-root>/scripts/oh-no-config" off
```

If the plugin root is not exposed, locate the installed script first according
to the active platform runtime document.

```bash
script="$(find <platform-plugin-cache> -path '*/oh-no-harness/*/scripts/oh-no-config' -print -quit)"
"$script" status
```

## Response Rules

- For `on`, enable the setting, report the config path, and tell the user to
  restart or clear the active platform session before expecting the new behavior.
- For `off`, disable the setting, report the config path, and tell the user to
  restart or clear the active platform session before expecting the new behavior.
- For `status`, report whether auto-routing is on or off and where the setting is stored.
- If Bash is unavailable, explain the config file shape without claiming the setting changed.
- Do not invoke workflow skills from this configuration skill.

# Claude Code Platform Rules

This platform section is source content for generated Claude Code-facing
runtime skill documents.

## Skill Loading

Claude Code-facing public skills live under `skills-claude/`. Files in
`skills-claude/<skill>/SKILL.md` are generated runtime documents composed from
the matching `docs/skill-core/<skill>.md` file, this Claude Code platform file,
and any Claude Code skill-specific overlay such as
`docs/platforms/claude-code-<skill>.md`.

Claude slash commands must delegate to `skills-claude/<skill>/SKILL.md` so the
model sees the generated Claude Code runtime document for that skill.

## User Approval

When asking the user for approval, preference, scope, or next-step selection,
use the available structured question tool when the host exposes one. Prefer one
focused question at a time. For option questions, provide a small set of
mutually exclusive choices and put the recommended option first when there is a
clear recommendation.

If a structured question tool is unavailable, ask in plain text and wait for the
user's answer. Present options as actions the host agent will take. Do not tell
the user to run a command manually when the skill handoff expects the host agent
to invoke the next skill.

## Task Tracking

When a core skill has a multi-phase approval handoff and the host exposes task
tracking, create one task per phase and complete them sequentially. Do not
collapse content approval and next-step selection into one hidden step.

## Auto Routing

The `auto-routing` skill controls whether the Claude Code SessionStart hook adds
stronger skill-selection guidance to `using-oh-no-harness`.

Preferred config location:

```text
$HOME/.claude/plugins/data/<oh-no-harness-*>/config.json
```

When `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set, use:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/oh-no-config" status
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/oh-no-config" on
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/oh-no-config" off
```

Changes take effect on the next Claude Code `SessionStart`, such as a new
session, app restart, `/clear`, or compaction.

## Anthropic-Aligned Prompting

This file carries the runtime-sized Anthropic guidance for Claude Code. The
longer maintenance reference lives in `docs/providers/anthropic.md`, but
generated Claude Code-facing runtime skill documents do not include provider
docs as an extra runtime source.

For Anthropic/Claude models, keep instructions explicit and sectioned:

- state scope, non-goals, constraints, approval gates, and expected evidence in
  stable headings or tagged sections
- avoid relying on implication; say what the agent may do, must not do, and must
  ask before changing
- give one focused user question at a time when approval or direction is needed
- preserve long-running context in artifacts before compaction, task handoff, or
  subagent dispatch
- keep final answers concise unless the active skill requires a structured plan,
  review, or verification report

When the host exposes extended thinking or effort controls, use higher effort
for agentic coding, architecture review, plan critique, and ambiguous debugging.
Use lower effort for small, already-bounded edits.

## Role Dispatch

Claude Code subagent descriptions are delegation metadata. Generated
`agents/*.md` descriptions may keep the `Use proactively` trigger so Claude can
select useful role agents, but they must bind that proactivity to active Oh No
Harness workflows and caller-owned approval and handoff gates. The agent body
contains the stable role contract; the Task, Agent, or Workflow prompt supplies
the current story scope, acceptance criteria, contract surface, baseline guard,
expected output, and lifecycle.

Use the available Task, Agent, Workflow `agent()`, or subagent mechanism for
role dispatch. Prefer plugin-scoped agents named `oh-no-harness:<role>` when
the host lists them.

For independent read-only, review, verification, QA, security, or exploration
work, request background subagents and start the whole independent batch before
waiting for any one result.
When a skill requires an atomic same-phase batch, prefer Workflow `Promise.all`
if available; direct Task or Agent background notifications may arrive before
the model has emitted later task requests, so do not inspect or summarize those
results until the full intended batch has been requested.

After a Claude Code subagent reaches a final status, capture the output and any
changed-file set before cleanup. When no further input is needed, close or clean
up the completed subagent with the mechanism exposed by the host; if none is
available, record that fallback.

For approved `ralplan` handoffs to ordinary `oh-no-harness:ralph`, treat
`Parallel trigger: approved-plan-handoff` as dispatch authorization for
eligible isolated roles. Do not require a separate `ralph with parallel
subagents` option when the plan already lists roles whose output can change the
implementation, review, verification, or ship/block decision.

If plugin-scoped agents are unavailable, keep the same role boundary by
embedding the matching `agents/<role>.md` prompt into the available subagent
mechanism. If no dispatch mechanism is available, keep the role inline and
record the fallback reason when the core skill requires it.
