# Systematic Debugging for Claude Code

This generated file is the Claude Code-facing runtime skill document. Claude Code slash commands should read this file directly; maintainers edit the source documents listed below instead.

## Generated Runtime Composition

Source order:

- `../../docs/skill-core/systematic-debugging.md`
- `../../docs/platforms/claude-code.md`

The sections below are already composed for this platform. Do not ask the runtime model to load another platform's runtime document or invocation syntax.

# Systematic Debugging

Find the root cause before changing behavior.

This skill is the direct debugging entry point for failures that do not need the full `ralph` execution loop.

## Software Development Stage

Systematic Debugging is the failure-investigation and repair stage.

Use it when tests, builds, runtime behavior, installs, hooks, or user reports show a concrete failure. It should establish reproduction and root cause before returning to implementation or verification.

## When To Use

Use for:

- failing tests, builds, installs, hooks, or smoke checks
- regressions and unexpected behavior
- flaky or environment-sensitive behavior
- performance or integration failures
- repeated unsuccessful fixes

Do not use for greenfield feature work. Use `ralplan` or `ralph` when the task is broader than a bounded failure.

## Agent Roles

Use the listed roles as the failure requires. On subagent-capable hosts, use
isolated diagnostic and evidence roles when they provide decision-changing
evidence, context separation, or latency benefit so logs, traces, and
exploratory output do not pollute the main thread. The normal flow is diagnostic first
(`debugger` and, when context is missing, `explore`), then the minimal fix
(`executor` subagent when the write scope is isolated, otherwise inline with a
recorded reason), then evidence (`verifier`). `plan-reviewer` is a
conditional escalation role, not a required final step: use it immediately when
three fix attempts fail, architecture-level coupling appears, or the apparent
fix would change broad APIs, product behavior, data handling, security, or
delivery scope. Dispatch is governed by the active skill's platform policy and
Ralph's `## Mode-Gated Agent Dispatch` when this debugging pass is inside Ralph.
For direct debugging outside Ralph, apply `docs/shared/ralph-subagent-policy.md`
and `docs/shared/parallel-subagents.md` for role isolation, fallback reasons, and
eligible batch dispatch.

Apply the active platform's dispatch authorization for this skill's diagnostic,
fix, evidence, and post-fix review roles. Do not ask for per-run subagent
approval when the active platform already supplies standing authorization for
eligible `debugger`, `explore`, isolated `executor`, `verifier`, conditional
`plan-reviewer`, or warranted post-fix review roles. Use inline fallback only
when dispatch is unavailable, unsafe to isolate, or too small to benefit, and
record the fallback reason.

Respect the active platform runtime document for dispatch versus inline
execution. Do not collapse diagnostic or evidence roles inline when the host can
dispatch them with an isolated scope. When any listed role is dispatched, apply
the active platform's role prompt and dispatch requirements before the
task-specific failure, scope, expected output, and verification responsibility.

| Agent | Dispatch (when) |
|---|---|
| `debugger` | Dispatch `debugger` subagent to reproduce the failure, identify root cause, and recommend the minimal fix. |
| `explore` | Dispatch `explore` subagent to gather codebase facts, related call sites, working examples, and commands. |
| `executor` | Dispatch `executor` subagent to apply the minimal fix only after root cause and reproduction evidence exist. |
| `verifier` | Dispatch `verifier` subagent to confirm the fix and package evidence; its scenario lens covers post-fix validation when the failure affects user-facing flows, scenarios, or acceptance criteria. |
| `plan-reviewer` | Dispatch `plan-reviewer` subagent as a conditional escalation to reassess direction after three failed fix attempts, when architecture-level coupling is exposed, or before broad API/product/data/security/scope changes. |
| `code-reviewer` | Dispatch `code-reviewer` post-fix when the changed code is nontrivial, shared, workflow-affecting, or maintainability-sensitive, or when its security lens is needed because auth, data, file system, network, secrets, sandbox, or policy-sensitive behavior is touched. |

## Debugging Flow

1. Capture the exact failure command, input, environment, or user-visible symptom.
2. Reproduce the failure, or explain why it cannot be reproduced yet.
3. Read the relevant error output, logs, stack trace, and changed files.
4. Find the closest working example in the same codebase.
5. Build a hypothesis ledger before deep investigation:
   - For obvious, localized failures, record the single active hypothesis and
     why additional hypotheses would not change the next diagnostic step.
   - For unknown, nontrivial, flaky, repeated, or cross-boundary failures,
     record 2-3 plausible competing hypotheses before investigating any one
     deeply.
   - For each ledger entry, name the expected confirming evidence, expected
     refuting evidence, current confidence, and the smallest diagnostic step.
6. Select one active root-cause hypothesis from the ledger with evidence.
7. Test the active hypothesis with the smallest diagnostic step, update the
   ledger, and reject or replace the hypothesis when evidence contradicts it.
8. Trace the causal chain from the observed symptom back to the source that made
   the symptom possible. Do not accept a fix plan that only removes the visible
   trigger while leaving the failure mode latent.
9. For behavior fixes, read and follow `test-driven-development` to create a
   failing reproduction test before changing production code.
10. If reproduction and hypothesis evidence exist but the diagnosis remains
    contradictory, repeatedly inconclusive, or blocked after ordinary diagnostic
    passes, read and follow `fusion-rescue`. Return control to
    Systematic Debugging with the synthesis before applying a fix.
11. Apply the minimal fix with `executor` when the write scope is isolated; use
    inline work only with a recorded reason.
12. Dispatch warranted post-fix review roles when the changed scope or risk
    requires them.
13. Run the reproduction check, relevant regression checks, and
    `verification-before-completion` before claiming the failure is fixed. The
    verification evidence must show that the failure mode is gone, not only that
    the current trigger no longer appears in this environment.

Parallel hypothesis testing for steps 5-7: when reproduction is established and
two or more plausible root-cause hypotheses are independently testable, dispatch
one `debugger` subagent per hypothesis (cap 3) in a single batch. Step 6's
one-active-hypothesis rule applies per debugger agent: each parallel debugger
receives exactly one hypothesis, the confirming/refuting evidence it should look
for, and its read-only diagnostic scope. Each parallel debugger runs only
non-mutating diagnostics in disjoint scopes and returns evidence, confidence
movement, and rejected-hypothesis rationale; if diagnostics would mutate state
or scopes overlap, keep the sequential one-active-hypothesis flow above. The
main thread synthesizes the returned evidence, selects the confirmed root cause,
and a single `executor` applies the fix. Below two hypotheses, or when
hypotheses are not independently testable, the sequential flow above applies
unchanged.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and ask or escalate to `plan-reviewer` when:

- the failure cannot be reproduced and more data is needed from the user
- a `plan-reviewer` escalation trigger from `## Agent Roles` fires (repeated
  failed fix attempts; broad architecture or API scope; product behavior,
  data handling, security, or delivery-scope ambiguity)

## Anti-Patterns

- Changing code before reproducing or locating the failure.
- Fixing the stack-trace line when the bad value originated elsewhere.
- Bundling cleanup or refactors with a bug fix.
- Adding broad retries, catch-all handlers, or sleeps without evidence.
- Treating a later passing test as TDD evidence when no failing reproduction was
  observed first.
- Treating a passing trigger check as proof when the underlying failure mode or
  causal chain was not closed.
- Skipping competing hypotheses for an unknown or repeated failure because one
  log line looks familiar.

## Output

Return:

- Failure reproduced or reproduction blocker.
- Hypothesis ledger, including rejected hypotheses and evidence.
- Root cause and evidence.
- Causal chain and why the fix removes the failure mode.
- Reproduction test or documented exception.
- Fix summary.
- Verification commands and results.
- Residual risk.

## Next Skill Handoff

None — this is a failure-investigation mid-loop skill. It may use
`fusion-rescue` as a bounded internal escalation when ordinary diagnostics
stall, then return to this debugging flow. After verification, return the result
to the caller (`ralph`, `ultrawork`, or direct invocation). Do not chain to
another workflow skill.

# Claude Code Platform Rules

This platform section is source content for generated Claude Code-facing
runtime skill documents.

## Skill Loading

Claude Code-facing public skills live under `skills-claude/`. Files in
`skills-claude/<skill>/SKILL.md` are generated runtime documents composed from
the matching `docs/skill-core/<skill>.md` file, this Claude Code platform file,
and any Claude Code skill-specific overlay such as
`docs/platforms/claude-code-<skill>.md`.

Claude slash commands must delegate to `skills-claude/<skill>/SKILL.md` so the
model sees the generated Claude Code runtime document for that skill.

## User Approval

When asking the user for approval, preference, scope, or next-step selection,
use the available structured question tool when the host exposes one. Prefer one
focused question at a time. For option questions, provide a small set of
mutually exclusive choices and put the recommended option first when there is a
clear recommendation.

If a structured question tool is unavailable, ask in plain text and wait for the
user's answer. Present options as actions the host agent will take. Do not tell
the user to run a command manually when the skill handoff expects the host agent
to invoke the next skill.

## Task Tracking

When a core skill has a multi-phase approval handoff and the host exposes task
tracking, create one task per phase and complete them sequentially. Do not
collapse content approval and next-step selection into one hidden step.

## Auto Routing

The `auto-routing` skill controls whether the Claude Code SessionStart hook adds
stronger skill-selection guidance to `using-oh-no-harness`.

Preferred config location:

```text
$HOME/.claude/plugins/data/<oh-no-harness-*>/config.json
```

When `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set, use:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/oh-no-config" status
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/oh-no-config" on
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/oh-no-config" off
```

Changes take effect on the next Claude Code `SessionStart`, such as a new
session, app restart, `/clear`, or compaction.

## Anthropic-Aligned Prompting

This file carries the runtime-sized Anthropic guidance for Claude Code. The
longer maintenance reference lives in `docs/providers/anthropic.md`, but
generated Claude Code-facing runtime skill documents do not include provider
docs as an extra runtime source.

For Anthropic/Claude models, keep instructions explicit and sectioned:

- state scope, non-goals, constraints, approval gates, and expected evidence in
  stable headings or tagged sections
- avoid relying on implication; say what the agent may do, must not do, and must
  ask before changing
- give one focused user question at a time when approval or direction is needed
- preserve long-running context in artifacts before compaction, task handoff, or
  subagent dispatch
- keep final answers concise unless the active skill requires a structured plan,
  review, or verification report

When the host exposes extended thinking or effort controls, use higher effort
for agentic coding, architecture review, plan critique, and ambiguous debugging.
Use lower effort for small, already-bounded edits.

## Role Dispatch

Claude Code subagent descriptions are delegation metadata. Generated
`agents/*.md` descriptions may keep the `Use proactively` trigger so Claude can
select useful role agents, but they must bind that proactivity to active Oh No
Harness workflows and caller-owned approval and handoff gates. The agent body
contains the stable role contract; the Task, Agent, or Workflow prompt supplies
the current story scope, acceptance criteria, contract surface, baseline guard,
expected output, and lifecycle.

Use the available Task, Agent, Workflow `agent()`, or subagent mechanism for
role dispatch. Prefer plugin-scoped agents named `oh-no-harness:<role>` when
the host lists them.

For independent read-only, review, verification, QA, security, or exploration
work, request background subagents and start the whole independent batch before
waiting for any one result.
When a skill requires an atomic same-phase batch, prefer Workflow `Promise.all`
if available; direct Task or Agent background notifications may arrive before
the model has emitted later task requests, so do not inspect or summarize those
results until the full intended batch has been requested.

After a Claude Code subagent reaches a final status, capture the output and any
changed-file set before cleanup. When no further input is needed, close or clean
up the completed subagent with the mechanism exposed by the host; if none is
available, record that fallback.

For approved `ralplan` handoffs to ordinary `oh-no-harness:ralph`, treat
`Parallel trigger: approved-plan-handoff` as dispatch authorization for
eligible isolated roles. Do not require a separate `ralph with parallel
subagents` option when the plan already lists roles whose output can change the
implementation, review, verification, or ship/block decision.

If plugin-scoped agents are unavailable, keep the same role boundary by
embedding the matching `agents/<role>.md` prompt into the available subagent
mechanism. If no dispatch mechanism is available, keep the role inline and
record the fallback reason when the core skill requires it.
